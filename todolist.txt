Needed stuff
----------------

Structures:
Heap
Hash
BIT
Segment Tree
DSU

Graphs:
Tarjan SCC
Articulation vertices, bridges, BCC
Prim / Kruskal MST
- Euler Tour (Possibly skip for now?)
- Ford-Fulkerson (Possibly skip for now?)
- LCA (2^n)

Shortest path:
Dijkstra
Bellman-Ford
Floyd-Warshall

Other:
- Graham Scan for CH (Important)
- K-D Tree (BST*k)
- Knuth-Morris-Pratt / Z-algorithm (Important)
- Suffix Array (Petar says it's important?!)

Also, add some more elementary shit and sort it to make it more useful. But some other time.
